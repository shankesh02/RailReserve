# RailReserve
**RailReserve** is a software that handles the entire booking data of the railways. It is fully based on the concept of reserving train tickets for various destinations. Previously, handling the tickets was very difficult, so there was a need for software that could handle all railway reservations.
 
The Railway Reservation system facilitates the passengers to enquire about the available trains, booking and cancellation of tickets, enquire about the status of booked tickets, etc. We aimed to design and develop a database maintaining the records of different trains, train status, and passengers. While using this new reservation system passengers will be provided two options at this project homepage, and those two are register and login. If the user does not have their account, they can create a new account and if the user has an existing account, they can access it by using their passenger ID and password.

This program enables us to choose the train and there is no necessity to fill out a form at the railway Reservation counter, i.e., we can directly select from the choices provided by us with the train numbers and their origin, departure time, and destination. The program gives us the output as a train ticket with the amount to be paid. It is completely developed in C language without using graphics. This simplifies the risk and makes things faster in the mode of railways.
